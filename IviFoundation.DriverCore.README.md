# IviFoundation.DriverCore Shared Component 

The IVI Driver Core Shared Library contains an interface that may be implemented by drivers to satisfy the IVI .NET requirement that drivers shall implement an IVI-defined interface that includes certain members.

For details on IVI Generation 2026 and the associated standards, see <https://ivifoundation.org>.  The standard regulating this package can be found at [IVI Foundation](https://www.ivifoundation.org/downloads/PostGen2025/IviDriverNet.pdf) or on [github](https://github.com/IviFoundation/IviDrivers/blob/main/IviDriverNet/1.0/Spec/IviDriverNet.md).

The interface in the assembly of this NuGet package provides generally useful utility APIs for working with IVI drivers.  In addition, providing this common interface permits drivers to be used abstractly.

## Overview

The IVI **DriverCore** .NET Shared Components are used to develop and use IVI.NET Framework and .NET 6.0+ drivers. These shared components provide a standardized set of services that are common across all IVI .NET Framework and .NET 6.0+ drivers, ensuring consistency and compatibility when combining drivers and software from various vendors.

## Key Features

- IVI Driver .NET Specification version 1.0
- Target .NET Standard 2.0

## Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how you can use `IviDriverCore` Shared Component in your .NET project:

```csharp
using Ivi.DriverCore;
 
public class Example
{
    public void InitializeDriver()
    {
        // Example usage of IVI Driver Core
        var driver = new IviDriver();
        driver.Initialize();
        Console.WriteLine("Driver Initialized Successfully.");
    }
}
```
