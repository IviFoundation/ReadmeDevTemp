# IVI Driver Configurable Settings Shared Library

The IVI Driver Configurable Settings Shared Library contains binaries for the development and use of drivers that implement the IVI Generation 2014.

To enable migration of previous generations of drivers and the feature set the IVI Foundation provides this package as well as other packages named *IviFoundation.Driver.\**. These components are a port of the existing IVI 2014 .NET Framework Shared Components to .NET 6. They are delivered to support making IVI 2014 .NET Framework drivers compatible with .NET 6+.

Although not the subject of a IVI standard, these components are maintained by the IVI Foundation.  For more information regarding these compionents see [IVI .NET Drivers with CS Shared Components](https://www.ivifoundation.org/downloads/PostGen2025/IviDotNetDriversWithCSSharedComponents.pdf) or on [github](https://github.com/IviFoundation/IviDrivers/blob/main/Documentation/DriversWithCSSC/Documentation).
