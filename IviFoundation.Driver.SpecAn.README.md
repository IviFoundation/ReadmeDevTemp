# IVI SpecAn Class CSSC

The SpecAn Class CSSC (Configurable Settings Shared Components) packages contain libraries for the development and use of drivers that are migrated from IVI Generation 2014.

The libraries in this package provide an interchangeable definition for spectrum analyzers. The SpecAn class is designed to support typical spectrum analyzers as well as common extended functionality found in more complex instruments.  For the detailed specification of the API see [IVI Specifications](https://www.ivifoundation.org/specifications/default.html).

This package enables migration of previous generations of drivers, and those that implement their features.  This package and other packages named *IviFoundation.Driver.\** are used by those drivers. These components are an extension of the existing IVI 2014 .NET Framework Shared Components to also support .NET 6. They are delivered to support making IVI 2014 .NET Framework drivers to also be compatible with .NET 6+.

These components are maintained by the IVI Foundation.  For more information regarding these components see [IVI .NET Drivers with CSSC](https://github.com/IviFoundation/IviDrivers/blob/main/Documentation/IviDotNetDriversWithCSSharedComponents.md).

## Using this Package With .NET Framework

This package has reference assemblies for .NET Framework.  Therefore, if you are using this package in a .NET Framework application you also need to install the corresponding IVI .NET CSSC assemblies.  To get that package, see [IVI Foundation Downloads](https://ivifoundation.org/downloads/default.html).

## Additional Information

If you are using these components to dynamically configure a driver, see [IVI .NET Drivers with CSSC](https://github.com/IviFoundation/IviDrivers/blob/main/Documentation/IviDotNetDriversWithCSSharedComponents.md) for additional information.

To report defects please [contact the IVI Foundation](https://ivifoundation.org/contact.html).
